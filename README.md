# RESTful APIs for our Audio Streaming App

## Audio Meta Data Indexer

The MP3 audio files of our Internet radio station are located on the Shoutcast audio streaming server where they can also be accessed by the Audio Meta Data Indexer to extract the ID3 tag information for album name, album artwork (image), artist name, song name and year. This meta data will be written into a database which will then be used by the Audio Streaming App to show a navigation menu.

Currently working on a mockup https://mockingbot.com/app/661ae9f6b43f83ad675b8c27c505646ddbc894d4.
